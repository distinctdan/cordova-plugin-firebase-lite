This plugin is mostly cloned from [cordova-plugin-firebasex](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-firebasex).

This plugin is basically just for crashlytics. It includes the performance and analytics firebase plugins, but not all funcionality has been implemented. It has been created because there are a lot of issues with many of the other firebase plugins out there, and I only really need crashlytics. Loading fewer modules also equals faster app boot time.

Supported platforms: Android and iOS
